This is an application designed for particle tracking and Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) calculation 
to determine the diffusion coefficient. It is used for the teaching of "Measurement of Avogadro's constant via diffusion coefficient" in the course of "物理实验(下)" of Fudan University.

Features include:
- Particle tracking in video or sequential frames
- MSD calculation and statistical error estimation
- Diffusion coefficient calculation
- Handling of average drift
